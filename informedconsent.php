        <h3>         Informed Consent to Chiropractic Care  </h3>
        <p><em>Please review this information.  The following signature page will be provided for you at the time of your visit.</em> </p>
            <p>Chiropractic is a science and art, which concerns itself with the relationship between structure (primarily the spine) and function (primarily the nervous system) as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health. Health is a state of optimal physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or </p>
<p>One disturbance to the nervous system is called a vertebral subluxation. This occurs when one or more of the 24 vertebrae in the spinal column become misaligned and/or do not move properly. This causes alteration of nerve function and interference to the nervous system. This may result in pain and dysfunction or may be entirely. </p>
<p>Subluxations are corrected and/or reduced by an adjustment. An adjustment is the specific application of forces to correct and/or reduce vertebral subluxation. Ourchiropractic method of correction is by specific adjustments of the spine. Adjustments are done either by hand or performed by gentle handheld instruments. In addition, ancillary procedures such as soft tissue therapy and/or rehabilitation procedures may be included.</p>
<p>If during the course of care we encounter non-chiropractic or unusual findings, we will advise you of those findings and recommend that you seek the services of another health care provider. </p>
<p>I understand that, as with any health care procedure, there are certain complications, which may arise during a chiropractic adjustment. Those complications include but are not limited to: fractures, disc injuries, dislocations, muscle strains, ligament sprains and stroke. I do no expect the doctor to be able to anticipate and explain all risks and complications and I wish to rely on the doctor to exercise judgment during the course of the procedure(s) which the doctor feels at the time, based upon the facts then known, are in my best interests.</p>
<p>I have had an opportunity to discuss with the doctor of chiropractic named above the nature, purpose and risks of chiropractic adjustments and other procedures and have had my questions answered to my satisfaction. I understand that results are not guaranteed. </p>
<p>I have read, or have had read to me, the above explanation of the chiropractic adjustment and related treatment. By signing below, I state that I have weighed the risks involved in undergoing treatment and have myself decided that it is in my best interest to undergo the chiropractic treatment recommended. Having been informed of the risks, I hereby give my consent to that treatment. I intend this consent form to cover the entire course of treatment for my present condition and for any future condition(s) for which I seek treatment.</p>
